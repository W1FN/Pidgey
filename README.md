# W1FN Pidgey :bird: (Raspberry Pi APRS Digipeater)

A lightweight APRS Digipeater/iGate that runs in memory, with no writes to the SD card at runtime.
Specifically configured for the Twin State Radio Club (W1FN), but should be relatively easy to adapt for other usage.

## Usage

### Installation

You can image the SD card via `dd`, or whatever various imaging tool you like.

### Per-Device Configuration

All paths in this section are relative to the sdcard root.
The SD card is a FAT partition, so it should be editable on Linux/MacOS/Windows/etc.

- set the hostname in `/config/etc/hostname`
- add wireguard wg-quick config file(s) to `/config/etc/wireguard/{whatever}.conf`
- add SSH pubkey(s) to `/config/home/pidgey/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- if using wifi: add `/config/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` generated by `wpa_passphrase`
- edit `/config.txt` to select the UDRC or DRAWS overlay
- add Dire Wolf config to `/config/etc/direwolf.conf`
- boot up the device and adjust audio levels
  - `setalsa-*.sh` scripts have some pre-made defaults from n7nix
  - if using `alsamixer`, remember to save these via `alsactl store`
  - `direwolf` can produce a level calibration tone when run with `-x` (ex `direwolf -c /etc/direwolf.conf -x`)

**If you edit files on the device at runtime, they will be lost unless copied to `/boot/config/`.**
**You can use the `persist` script for this purpose.**
**It will copy all files given on the command line, or check for changes to files in `/boot/config` if no arguments are passed.**

### Logs

Log files for direwolf are stored on a USB drive, if one is inserted.
FAT32 and ext3/4 formatted drives are supported.
Logs can be found at `/direwolf-logs/` on the USB drive, or `/var/log/direwolf` on a running system.

The dated files are direwolf's CSV logs, which contain recieved packets.
Logs older than 2 days will be compressed with gzip, and can be read with `zcat`.

Stdout and stderr are stored in the `stdout` folder, which is managed by [`s6-log`](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-log.html).
You can follow this log with `s6-logwatch /var/log/direwolf/stdout/ | less +F` (piping this through `less +F` just cleans up the colors) or just `less +F /var/log/direwolf/stdout/current` (but this will not correctly switch files when the log is rotated).
Old logs are named with a [TAI64N](http://skarnet.org/software/skalibs/libstddjb/tai.html#timestamp) timestamp with the pattern `@<timestamp>.s`, and are also gzipped.

## Building

This is a [buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) project, so all upstream dependencies apply.

1. Either clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules` or after cloning run `git submodule update --init` to download buildroot.
2. `cd buildroot`
3. `make BR2_EXTERNAL=../br_external menuconfig` (or `xconfig`) and save the configuration
4. `make pidgey_defconfig` to select the config
5. `make -jX`, where X is the number of parallel jobs to run (generally around the number of CPU cores you have)
6. flash `output/images/sdcard.img` to a sd card, and put it in a Raspberry Pi 3
