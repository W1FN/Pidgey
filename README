Base on Romain Reignier work : https://github.com/romainreignier/minimal_raspberrypi_buildroot

# Build

```
git clone https://github.com/naguirre/binky_buildroot.git
cd binky_buildroot
```

Sync git submodules, it will download buildroot itself.
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Patch libnfc package, as the current package doesn't build acr122_usb libnfc driver
```
cd buildroot
patch -p1 < ../add_acr122_usb_driver_to_libnfc_package.patch
cd ..
```

Launch the build
```
make binky_defconfig
make
```

Onnce build is finished you can flash a SDCard with the image generated  : Image is located in
```

```

you can use dd to flash the sdcard or etcher https://www.balena.io/etcher/
